1) write a blog on difference between document and windows object ?


* Document Object

* What is the Document Object?

            The Document object is a core component of the DOM and represents the web page itself. It serves as an interface to interact with the content
  and structure of an HTML document. When you load a web page in your browser, the Document object is created, representing the entire page, 
  including all its elements, such as headings, paragraphs, images, forms, and more.

* Key Characteristics of Document Objects:
          Hierarchical Structure: The Document object models the hierarchical structure of the HTML document.
  It organizes elements in a tree-like structure, making it easy to access and manipulate them using JavaScript.

*        Content Manipulation: With the Document object, you can manipulate the content of a web page by adding, modifying, 
 or removing elements dynamically. This is the foundation for creating interactive web applications.

*        Access to Elements: Document objects provide methods and properties to access and traverse elements within the DOM. 
 For instance, you can use getElementById, querySelector, or getElementsByTagName to find and interact with specific elements on the page.

*        Event Handling: You can attach event handlers to Document objects to respond to user interactions, such as clicks, form submissions, 
 or keyboard inputs.

* Window Object

* What is the Window Object?
         The Window object represents the browser window or tab in which a web page is loaded. It serves as an interface to control and interact
  with the browser itself. Every open browser window or tab has its own Window object, and this object is the top-level object in the browser's
  JavaScript environment.
 
* Key Characteristics of Window Objects:
       Global Scope: Variables and functions defined in the global scope of a script are attached to the Window object.
 This makes them accessible throughout the script and across different scripts running in the same window or tab.

* Browser Control: The Window object allows you to control various aspects of the browser, such as opening and closing windows or tabs, 
  navigating to different URLs, resizing the window, and handling browser-specific features like alerts and prompts.

 Timers and Intervals: You can use Window object methods like setTimeout and setInterval to execute code at specified intervals or after a 
 certain delay. This is essential for implementing animations and asynchronous operations.

 Access to Document Object: The Window object provides access to the Document object. You can access the Document object of the current window/tab using window.document. This connection between the Window and Document objects enables you to manipulate the content of the web page.

* Key Differences
  Now that we've discussed the individual characteristics of Document and Window objects, let's summarize the key differences between them:

 *Scope: Document objects are limited in scope to the content of a single web page, while Window objects have a broader scope, encompassing 
 the entire browser window or tab.

 *Hierarchy: The Document object represents the hierarchical structure of the HTML document, whereas the Window object represents
  the browser window's environment.

 Content vs. Browser Control: Document objects focus on manipulating and interacting with the content of a web page,
 while Window objects provide control over the browser itself.

 Global vs. Local: Variables and functions attached to the Window object are global and can be accessed from anywhere within the script, 
 whereas Document objects deal with a localized
